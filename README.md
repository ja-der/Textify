# **uOttahack: Journey into Machine Learning Models - Learning from Challenges and Pivots**

### The models (even my failed one) are included 

ðŸŒŸ **Project Overview:**
For this hackathon, indecisiveness got the better of me as I changed ideas many many times. I decided with less than 24 hours left to create my own machine learning model. The goal was to develop a machine learning model capable of deciphering cursive handwriting. The initial goal was to create an AI that could read and transcribe handwritten notes efficiently. However, despite my best efforts and expertise, the intricacies of cursive writing posed significant challenges, and the desired results remained elusive. I did learn a lot about Tenserflow and using image processing libraries like OpenCV and Pillow, I learned to preprocess raw images effectively. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow enabled me to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pivotal for capturing spatial features in images. I learned about data augmentation, label encoding techniques and optimization algorithms which will help me in the future as I come back to tackle this problem.

ðŸ¤” **Challenges Faced:**
Figuring out cursive writing, with all its fancy styles and fancy loops, was a real challenge. My first try at a model didn't quite nail the accurate transcriptions, so I had to rethink where the project was going. Decided to switch gears and focus on a more practical and impactful use of machine learning in healthcare.

ðŸš€ **Project Pivot: Diabetic Diagnosis AI:**
Undeterred by the challenges in the handwriting domain, I redirected my efforts towards an equally impactful healthcare solution. The new project focused on developing an AI that analyzes signs and symptoms to diagnose diabetes in patients.

ðŸ‘‰ **Features of Diabetic Diagnosis AI:**
- Takes in signs and symptoms reported by patients.
- Applies machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.
- Provides a rapid and preliminary diagnosis of diabetes.
